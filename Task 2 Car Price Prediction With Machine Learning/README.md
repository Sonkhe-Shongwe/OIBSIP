# Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the selling prices of cars based on various attributes. By analyzing car features and developing predictive models, valuable insights are generated for buyers and sellers in the automotive market.

## Key Features

- Exploratory analysis of car attributes.
- Development of predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of model performance and selection of the best-performing model.
- Visualization of insights through intuitive charts and graphs.

## Model

The following regression models were used for predicting car prices:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Extra Trees Regression

The **Extra Trees Regression model** was identified as the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R^2). The model achieved an RMSE of 1.60 and an R-squared of 0.92.

## Results

- Identified significant relationships between car attributes and selling prices.
- Evaluated the performance of various regression models and determined that the **Extra Trees Regression model** outperformed others based on evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R-squared.
- Provided insights and recommendations for stakeholders in the automotive industry.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting car prices and provides valuable insights for buyers and sellers. By leveraging predictive modeling techniques and data analysis, stakeholders can make informed decisions and optimize pricing strategies in the automotive market.
