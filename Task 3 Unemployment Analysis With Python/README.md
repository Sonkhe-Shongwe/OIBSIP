## Objectives

1. **Analyze Employment Trends:** Examine changes in employment rates across India, highlighting differences between urban and rural areas to identify the most impacted regions.
2. **Evaluate COVID-19 Impact:** Assess the pandemic's effect on employment patterns by comparing data from pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.
3. **Understand Labor Force Participation:** Investigate how the economic downturn has affected labor market participation, focusing on shifts during the pandemic.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods to explore employment rate differences and correlations between labor participation and unemployment rates.
5. **Inform Policy Recommendations:** Provide insights to help policymakers and stakeholders develop strategies for economic recovery and support affected workers.
   
## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The project begins with loading and preprocessing the employment data, ensuring its quality and preparing it for analysis.

## Statistical Analysis

### Hypothesis Testing

#### Hypothesis 1: Employment Rate Difference by Area

- **H0:** There is no significant difference in the average employment rates between rural and urban areas.
- **H1:** There is a significant difference in the average employment rates between rural and urban areas.

Results: 

| Statistic    | Value                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| T-statistic  | 10.45                              |
| P-value      | $$6.46 \times 10^{-24}$$           |

#### Hypothesis 2: Labor Participation Rate and Employment Rate Correlation

- **H0:** There is no correlation between the labor participation rate and the employment rate.
- **H1:** There is a correlation between the labor participation rate and the employment rate.

Results: 

| Statistic            | Value                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Correlation Coefficient | 0.011                     |
| P-value              | 0.759                         |

#### Hypothesis 3: Variations in Employment Rates Across Different Regions (ANOVA Test)

- **H0:** There are no significant differences in the average employment rates across different regions.
- **H1:** There are significant differences in the average employment rates across different regions.

Results: 

| Statistic    | Value                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| F-statistic  | 58.23                              |
| P-value      | $$3.21 \times 10^{-160}$$          |
